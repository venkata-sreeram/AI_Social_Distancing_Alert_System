# AI_Social_Distancing_Alert_System

## Introduction to this Project:
To contain the spread of covid-19, the Central government announced lockdown measures in four phases and the citizens were advised to stay at home. Detailed guidelines were issued for permitting different activities in different phases of lockdown with a focussed approach to mitigate the spread of disease. Technology-driven innovations and solutions amid the covid-19 situation have helped India to handle and contain the pandemic in a way better than many other countries. Now the task of ensuring social distancing norms, face mask and crowd management in the new normal is going to be the most crucial one in the fight against the pandemic for India. Next-gen technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Image-recognition may be leveraged for enforcing and maintaining Social Distancing and for detection of violations of mandatory face masks in public places.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is that wave sweeping the technology world today. If you want to join this revolution but do not have the skills yet, this series of courses are right for you.In addition to the development of machine learning that leads to new capabilities, we have subsets within the domain of machine learning, each of which offers a potential area of specialization for those interested in a career in AI.

## 2.1 Overview 
The main Concept of this Project is to understand how computer vision is Useful for Detecting the Social-Distance between two persons. For this, We have Used Open CV with Python & Neural Networks to calculate the Distance between the Persons and Identifying the people who are Violating the Social distance and who are non-Violating the Social Distancing Rules. Some of the Description about the Project ahs Mentioned below: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is that wave sweeping the technology world today. If you want to join this revolution but do not have the skills yet, this series of courses are right for you.In addition to the development of machine learning that leads to new capabilities, we have subsets within the domain of machine learning, each of which offers a potential area of specialization for those interested in a career in AI.

#### ● Neural Networks:
Neural networks are integral for teaching computers to think and learn by classifying information, similar to how we as humans learn. With neural networks,the software can learn to recognize images, for example. Machines can also make predictions and decisions with a high level of accuracy based on data inputs.
#### ● Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
Natural language processing gives machines the ability to understand human language. As this develops, machines will learn to respond in a way a human audience can understand. In the future, this will dramatically change how we interface with all computers.
#### ● Deep Learning 
Deep learning is at the cutting-edge of intelligent automation. It focuses on machine learning tools and deploying them to solve problems by making decisions. With deep learning, data is processed through neural networks, getting closer to how we think as humans. Deep learning can be applied to images, text, and speech to draw conclusions that mimic human decision making.


## 2.1 Purpose of Social-Distancing Alert System: 
Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household. To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm's’ length) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces. in this Pandemic Situation Social Distancing is very Important Factor to be Noticed for preventing the spread of Virus & Other Diseases. For, this we have to take the Support of Physical humans to monitor who are violating the Rules. It's very Difficult to the human to monitor all the people. For that, we have taken the help of Artificial Intelligence which consists of Computer vision & Opencv helps to detect the people who are violating the rules and send alert messages. It was Observed that how the Neural networks takes place while detecting the persons & how it will give the Alert messages & how to link the webpage to this Application Project.
#### What are the Libraries & Packages included in this Project are:
     NumPy, Images with NumPy, Image and Video Basics with NumPy, Streaming video with OpenCV, Object Detection, Template Matching, Corner, Edge, and Grid Detection, Contour Detection, Feature Matching, Object Tracking, Optical Flow, Deep Learning with Keras, Keras and Convolutional Networks, Customized Deep Learning Networks, State of the Art YOLO Networks And much more..

## Applications of Social-Distancing Alert System:
We can Use this Application where the crowd are High. The below are the example Places In which we can Use this Application in CCTV
##### • Air Ports 
##### • Hospitals
###### • Offices
##### • Manufacturing Plants 
##### • Retail Shops 
##### • Metro Stations 
##### • Public Libraries 
##### • Schools
##### • Religious Places


## Conclusion: 
Hence I conclude that the Project- Social Distancing Alert System is Used to Detect the People who are Violating the Social Distancing as we mentioned the Distance required to mark as a Safe mark & Distance to Violate the Rules. as well as Confidence level is also an Important factor to tell the Machine on a factor of 100%, how much confidence level is Required to Identify the persons. This means it have to concentrate on Humans only not Objects. humans having the Structure and mark a centroid in each of the people and calculate the distance between the people. Based on the Euclidean Distancing Formula, we are calculating the Social Distancing.

## Future Scope:
The future scope of Artificial Intelligence involves using robots to help in reducing the Manpower & also do the Work In an Efficient way which is more Elegant than now. this Project may Uprises the Concepts of Self-Driving-Cars to Identify the Obstacles while taking the Curve. The computer Vision plays a vital role in Object-Detection. It can create new career paths in the field of Machine learning, Data mining, and analysis, AI software development, program management, and testing. The demand for AI certified professionals will grow along with the developments in AI.
